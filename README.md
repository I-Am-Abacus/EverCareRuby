# The Everest Team\'s WebApp

Rails element of web app to to manage Care Provision for vulnerable people.



NB The application as demonstrated on the night at SyncTheCity did not integrate calls of this back-end, due to an issue with maintaining session after sign-on. This is an issue we could have resolved with a little more time - probably by not using SessionStore. Note that this is the first time I have written any application that integrates with a front-end.

Please also note that we're aware this app has some workarounds & inconsistencies in API calling that would be cleaned up with a little more time for research. 



This application is based on elemets of the following (for user / session / static page support):-
